# cloudcasting-network-config-generator

## Getting started: Building

To create a production version of your app/site: 
--> generate a dist folder / our custom css & js

```
npm install
```

```bash
CSS build & watch
(Tailwind npx script in package.json ):

npm run watch
```

```bash
JS build & watch: (Laravel mix)
npm run watch-js
```

Laravel Mix is a clean layer on top of webpack to make the 80% use case laughably simple to execute. Most would agree that, though incredibly powerful, webpack ships with a steep learning curve. --> https://laravel-mix.com/docs/5.0/basic-example
